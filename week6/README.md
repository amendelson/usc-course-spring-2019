# Week 6
This week, we'll use those new mapping skills (and some old-fashioned problem solving) to tackle a breaking news challenge.

### Lecture

There is no lecture! No time! There's breaking news!

### Hands-on

We've got some piping-hot data: the latest unemployment figures for California.

You're the only data journalist around in the newsroom, and the editors want a map ASAP.

What do you do?

We'll go over how to wrangle that. And then you'll fire up QGIS to make a map of the rate by California county.

If we have time, we'll also make a comparison to February 2009.
